# TriProx

TriProx is going to be a Triway proxy hub service with games and proxies (hopefully)..

# Background
I'm a 13 year old nerd who likes coding and I'm hopefully gonna deploy it to Heroku or Azure (or even selfhost it on my laptop) and use a GoDaddy custom domain. I go to Triway and the site will hopefully be up by the end of June, which is a farshot since I'll be out of school in a couple days and will grind all day on this for fun.

# FAQ

Q: <br>
  What will the site have? <br>
A: <br>
  It will have Ultraviolet, Womginx, and hopefully Rammerhead + lots of games including: clickers, TriCraft (a fork of AyunCraft), platformers, and miscellaneous other games like Slope <br>
Q: <br>
  When will the site be up:  <br>
A: <br>
  Like I said earlier, hopefully mid-end of June, and when I get the change to buy a domain. \n
Q: <br>
  What will the domain be? <br>
A: <br>
  I'm not sure but I'll be sure to update the README when I get a domain. It'll probably change every year or when GoGuardian blocks it in our district. For now, TriCraft is currently on a custom domain and I might put it on that domain. If you want to play TriCraft at schools, message me on Discord (Gage#3758) or create an issue with a way to contact you.
